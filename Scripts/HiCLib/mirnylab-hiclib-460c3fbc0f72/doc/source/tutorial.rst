Tutorial
========

This tutorial gives a brief introduction into the basics of hiclib. It does not
introduce the advanced library features, nor does it cover the code used to 
produce the figures to the main publications about Hi-C data processing.

In this tutorial, we are going to download a single Hi-C dataset from the 
original work in 2009, map it to the genome, filter, apply iterative correction 
and visualize the obtained heatmap.

The source codes for the tutorial can be found in the library folder in 
examples/tutorial subfolder.
